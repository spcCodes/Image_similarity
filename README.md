## General info

The objective of this project is to find out the similar images from the images directory given a query image. The dataset for this project is available in data directory. However beacuse github has its own storage constraints all the data, all the data is not reflecting in the **data** folder . The data can be downloaded from **[dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_Qww0NbYJOH17IiTr7bgXWQTQTFD-V9R)**. If you face downloading the dataset , do drop me a mail to gain the access credentials.
